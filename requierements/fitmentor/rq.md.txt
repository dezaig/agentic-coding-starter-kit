## What I Want to Build
**FitMentor** â€” daily workouts + habits; AI adjusts plan; progress charts.

### Features
- Programs, workouts, exercises
- Habit tracking, streaks, reminders
- AI plan generator (goals, equipment, time)
- Wearable import (later)

### Routes
- `/plan`, `/workouts`, `/habits`, `/progress`

### DB
- users, goals, programs, workouts, exercises, logs, habits

### Guardrails
- Free tier: limited plan size; paid = full plan + exports
