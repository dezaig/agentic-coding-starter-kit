[Same boilerplate preamble as HelpBeam]

## What I Want to Build
**PostPilot** — plan, generate, and schedule social posts across X/Instagram/LinkedIn/TikTok.
- Content calendar with AI repurposing (one idea → multi-platform variants).
- Asset library, brand presets, first-comment and hashtag sets.
- Scheduling + queue; link tracking (UTM).

### Features
- Calendars, queues, approvals (roles)
- AI rewrite per network constraints
- Media upload/cropping, caption templates
- Integrations: X/IG/LinkedIn/TikTok posting APIs (use webhooks where available)
- Billing: seats + scheduled post quotas

### Routes
- `/calendar`, `/library`, `/captions`, `/integrations`, `/analytics`

### DB
- posts, platforms, schedules, media, projects, brand_presets, analytics_events

### Guardrails
- No API posting before account connection
- Free tier: draft-only (no publish)
