[Boilerplate preamble]

## What I Want to Build
**ClauseGuard** — upload a contract → AI flags risky clauses (liability, payment terms, IP), suggests edits, timeline reminders.

### Features
- Upload PDF/DOCX, parse structure
- Clause classifiers + risk scoring
- Plain-language summaries + suggested edits
- Key dates extraction → calendar reminders
- Audit history

### Routes
- `/contracts`, `/contracts/:id`, `/templates`, `/alerts`

### DB
- contracts, clauses, findings, suggestions, reminders, templates, usage

### Guardrails
- Show redacted sample report before payment
- Paid = full report + export (DOCX/PDF)
