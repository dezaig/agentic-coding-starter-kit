## What I Want to Build
**WatchTower** — monitor URLs (text/price/spec changes) → alerts + diffs; AI summarizes what's changed.

### Features
- URL watchers with frequency
- DOM/Text diff
- AI summary of changes
- Alerts: email/Slack/Discord/Zapier

### Routes
- `/watchers`, `/diff/:id`, `/alerts`

### DB
- watchers, snapshots, diffs, alerts, integrations

### Guardrails
- Rate limits per user; free tier small quotas
