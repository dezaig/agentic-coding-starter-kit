[Boilerplate preamble]

## What I Want to Build
**MicroMarket** â€” launch a vertical marketplace (e.g., tutors, artisans) with listings, search, booking, payments.

### Features
- Listings CRUD, search & filters
- Booking/requests, messaging
- Reviews, payouts (Stripe Connect)
- Admin moderation, fees

### Routes
- `/market`, `/listing/:id`, `/inbox`, `/dashboard` (seller)

### DB
- users, listings, categories, photos, bookings, messages, reviews, payouts, fees

### Guardrails
- Payments sandbox for trial; production requires KYC via Stripe Connect
